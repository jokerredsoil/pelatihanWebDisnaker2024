                                Names are an integral part of a person’s identity, reflecting culture, history, and even family expectations of the individual. One interesting example of the journey of a name is the case of Indonesian President Joko Widodo, whose real name was Mulyono. Although widely known as Joko Widodo, the journey of the name Mulyono to Joko Widodo provides interesting insights into the changes in identity and background. Reporting from kompas.com, Jokowi is the first child and only son of four siblings, with three younger sisters. His father, Widjiatno Noto, is a carpenter, and his mother, Sujiatmi Notomiharjo, is a housewife. At birth, the baby was originally named Mulyono, not Joko Widodo. In his interview, Jokowi explained that the change from Mulyono to Joko Widodo occurred because he experienced various childhood health problems. The name Mulyono, which means “noble”, was considered inappropriate for the baby’s condition. Therefore, the name was changed to Joko Widodo which means “a boy who is safe and prosperous”. On the other hand, account X, which discussed threats related to Jokowi's real name, raised topics about occult or mystical knowledge related to shamanism and ancestral spirits.

                                    On June 11, 2015, Gibran married Selvi Ananda, the winner of the 2009 Puteri Solo (Miss Solo) beauty pageant. They met when Gibran was a judge at the competition. The couple's first child, a son named Jan Ethes Srinarendra, was born on March 10, 2016. On November 15, 2019, Gibran's wife gave birth to a daughter at the Muhammadiyah Hospital in Surakarta. She was named La Lembah Manah.

                                    Gibran is a fan of FC Barcelona and has admitted to being a fan of the club for a long time. During his mayoral campaign in August 2020, he wore the club's jersey during an online training session with his supporters. Gibran is also a fan of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and The Adventures of Tintin, but he often uses Naruto in his media appearances.

                                    In September 2024, a controversy arose when a Kaskus account named "fufufafa", which was famous in the 2010s for posting controversial comments against certain political figures, especially Prabowo, was accused by Gerindra.org (a fake website) of belonging to Gibran. Gibran denied ownership of the account. A few weeks later, a Formspring account named "raka gnarly", known for posting sexual comments, was also alleged to belong to Gibran
