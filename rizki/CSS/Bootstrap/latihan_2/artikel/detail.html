                            <h4>The Time-Bombed Skycraper Tokei-jikake no Matenrō</h4>

                                The beginning of the story shows the murder of Kurokawa who was killed by his servant. After that, Conan at Professor Agasa's house is looking for a letter for himself, then he finds a letter for him from a famous Japanese architect, Teiji Moria. However, Conan (Shinichi) asks Ran to attend a tea party invitation at Teiji Moria's residence. Ran agrees to attend the invitation on the condition that on May 3 he must accompany Ran to watch the film "Benang Merah" at Beika City Building. After that, Conan, Ran, and his father Kogoro Mouri attend a tea party invitation at Teiji Moria's residence which is symmetrical and has an architectural style from England. Because Conan managed to answer the quiz, Ran and Conan were invited to the gallery of Teiji Moria's works from his youth. After arriving home, Conan hears news from the television that there has been a theft of explosives in very large quantities. Then, Conan is called by an unknown person, he tells him that there is a bomb in the park near the river. Then, Conan goes to the park and meets Ayumi, Genta, and Mitsuhiko who are playing with radio-controlled airplanes. It turned out that the plane was fitted with a bomb and exploded. The next bomb exploded near the highway and Conan was injured by the bomb explosion. And the biggest bomb was on the Toto Ring Road. Then, that night at Teiji Moria's residence, an investigation was conducted into the cases of successive fires and bomb explosions that occurred in all buildings designed by Teiji Moria. Until finally, the perpetrator was identified. However, the perpetrator installed the biggest bomb in the Beika City Building while Ran was there. The bomb exploded, but there was still the biggest bomb. Until finally, Ran, assisted by Shinichi (Conan), managed to defuse the bomb.
