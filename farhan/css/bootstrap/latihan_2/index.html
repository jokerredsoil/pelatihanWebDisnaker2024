                                Sadaharu has the outward appearance of a giant dog, but is actually an inugami. When sitting on his haunches, he is taller than most humans. He was left in front of Gintoki's apartment in a box that had "To Mr. Freelancer" written on it. Sadaharu chomps on anything smaller than itself, such as Gintoki's and other people's heads. Kagura seems to be the only one who can control him, for she has immense strength, though he chomps on her occasionally. Though he was dangerous when Gintoki first received him, he has become quite tame in the later episodes, and has helped the main characters in many occasions. He was named by Kagura, after her first pet, a rabbit which she accidentally killed while having a nightmare. He was originally owned by a pair of miko sisters, who initially called him Kamiko.

Recently, Sadaharu has impressed a yakuza's boss and receives permission to date his dog (whom Sadaharu himself has fallen in love for).

                                    Sadaharu was originally an Inugami (aka Dog God) of destruction and attack, watched over by the Priestess Sisters Ane and Mone. Sadaharu, along with his counterpart in charge of protection and defense, Komako, were entrusted with guarding the 龍脈 ryuumyaku aka Dragon's Pulse at the 龍穴 ryuuketsu aka Dragon's Lair on Earth but when the Amanto came, they built the Space Terminal over the Dragon's Pulse thus leaving Sadaharu and the sisters without a job. As time passed expenses became too high and they were forced to give Sadaharu away, and so they left him in the custody of the Yorozuya whom he has stayed with ever since.
